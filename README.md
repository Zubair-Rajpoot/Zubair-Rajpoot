👋 Hi there, I'm Zubair Rajpoot (@Zubair-Rajpoot)
🚀 Backend Developer | TypeScript Enthusiast | Blockchain Explorer
I'm a backend developer with hands-on experience in building scalable systems using Node.js, Express, and InversifyJS with TypeScript. I design and implement both monolithic and microservices architectures that are clean, efficient, and production-ready.

👨‍💻 What I Do
🔧 Build scalable and maintainable backend systems.

🧠 Follow clean architecture and SOLID principles using TypeScript + InversifyJS.

⚙️ Design RESTful APIs and integrate microservices seamlessly.

📦 Work with databases, message queues, and cloud-native technologies.

🤖 Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Google Gemini into backend services for automation, intelligent agents, and enhanced user experiences.

🔍 Currently Exploring
🌐 Blockchain development – diving into smart contracts, Web3, and decentralized applications.

🧩 Advanced use cases for LLMs in backend systems – including prompt engineering, semantic search, and AI-based assistants.

🛠️ Contributing to open source and learning about distributed systems.

🤝 Let's Collaborate
I'm open to working on exciting projects, especially those involving:

Backend system design & optimization

Blockchain and Web3 integration

LLM-powered backend features

Clean code and scalable architecture
